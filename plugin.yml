name: Chinmina Token
description: |
  Provides GitHub token retrieval from Chinmina in two modes:

  **Library Mode** (no `environment` parameter): Adds `chinmina_token` script to
  PATH for manual token retrieval in agent scripts.

  **Environment Mode** (`environment` parameter present): Automatically exports
  tokens to specified environment variables.

  The helper agent (separate) is accessed via HTTP, using the Buildkite Agent
  OIDC token as its authorization.
